# Master Thesis

## Introduction
This repository contains all the code concerning my Master Thesis on Convolutional Neural Architecture Search at ULB.

In this work, we seek to reduce the computational cost by using a simple hillclimbing [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04528) and accelerate
the learning process via knowledge transfer [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05641).
